## Dataset Loading and Preprocessing

1. **Loading Dataset**: Loaded the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame for analysis.
2. **Handling Missing Values**: Checked for missing values and handled them via imputation or removal.
3. **Standardizing Column Names**: Standardized column names by converting them to lowercase and removing spaces.
4. **Data Type Validation**: Validated data types and converted columns appropriately (e.g., dates to `datetime`, numerical values).

## Data Analysis

5. **Demographic Analysis**: Analyzed demographic distribution, including age and gender.
6. **Medical Conditions Distribution**: Examined the distribution of medical conditions.
7. **Blood Type Analysis**: Studied the distribution of blood types and their frequency.
8. **Hospital-wise Patient Distribution**: Visualized patient distribution across hospitals.
9. **Billing Analysis**: Analyzed billing amounts, including minimum, maximum, average, and outliers.
10. **Admission and Discharge Trends**: Studied trends in admissions and discharges by month or day.
11. **Admission Type Analysis**: Examined the relationship between admission type and medical conditions.

## Data Visualization

12. **Correlation Heatmaps**: Created heatmaps for numerical columns to identify relationships.
13. **Medication Trends**: Visualized trends in medications prescribed by doctors.
14. **Test Result Patterns**: Studied patterns in test results against medical conditions.
15. **Hospital Room Trends**: Analyzed room numbers for trends, such as occupancy patterns.
16. **Insurance Coverage Trends**: Examined trends in insurance providers and coverage amounts.

## Feature Engineering

17. **Length of Stay**: Created a new feature `Length of Stay` calculated as `discharge_date - admission_date`.
18. **Standardizing Data**: Standardized numerical columns for machine learning.
19. **Age Categories**: Grouped patients into age categories (e.g., children, adults, seniors).
20. **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Encoded variables like gender and blood type for modeling.
21. **Hospital Summary Statistics**: Aggregated data by hospital for summary statistics (e.g., average billing).

## Machine Learning Modeling

22. **Length of Stay Prediction**: Predicted `Length of Stay` based on patient attributes.
23. **Billing Amount Prediction**: Predicted billing amounts using features like age and medical condition.
24. **Readmission Prediction**: Used a binary classification model to predict readmission likelihood.
25. **Patient Clustering**: Performed clustering to segment patients using K-Means.
26. **Time-Series Analysis**: Conducted time-series analysis on admissions by date.
27. **Trend Forecasting**: Forecasted admission trends using ARIMA and Prophet.
28. **Outlier Detection**: Identified outliers in billing amounts using Isolation Forest.
29. **Anomaly Detection**: Detected anomalies in `Length of Stay` using Z-scores.

## Dashboard Creation

30. **Interactive Dashboards**: Created dashboards using Plotly and Tableau for visualizing key insights.
